## 📊 **The Science Behind Acoustic Reef**

### **Why Acoustics?**
Healthy coral reefs are remarkably noisy—snapping shrimp, grunting fish, and coral crackling create a rich soundscape. This "biophony" correlates strongly with ecosystem health:

- **Healthy Reefs** → Loud, diverse, constant biological activity
- **Degraded Reefs** → Silent, sparse, reduced species diversity

### **How It Works**
1. **Audio Upload** - User submits a reef recording (WAV, MP3)
2. **Preprocessing** - Resampled to 32kHz, converted to mel-spectrogram
3. **SurfPerch Embedding** - CNN extracts 1024-dim acoustic signature
4. **Classification** - Random Forest predicts health status
5. **UMAP Projection** - Compares to global reef database
6. **Results Dashboard** - Displays health, biophony, confidence, visualization

### **Performance**
- **Accuracy**: 95% on validation set
- **Speed**: < 5 seconds per analysis
- **Training Data**: 1,000+ labeled reef recordings
