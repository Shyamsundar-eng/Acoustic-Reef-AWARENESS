## üìä **The Science Behind Acoustic Reef**

### **Why Acoustics?**
Healthy coral reefs are remarkably noisy ecosystems. Snapping shrimp, grunting fish, sea urchins, and crackling coral create a rich underwater soundscape. This "biophony" correlates strongly with ecosystem health:

- **Healthy Reefs** ‚Üí Loud, diverse, constant biological activity
- **Degraded Reefs** ‚Üí Silent, sparse, reduced species diversity

Acoustic monitoring offers several advantages over traditional visual surveys:
- **Non-intrusive** - No need to disturb the ecosystem
- **Cost-effective** - Simple recording equipment vs. dive teams
- **Scalable** - Can monitor multiple sites simultaneously
- **Continuous** - 24/7 monitoring possible with autonomous recorders

### **How It Works**
1. **Audio Upload** - User submits a reef recording (WAV, MP3 format)
2. **Preprocessing** - Audio resampled to 32kHz, converted to mel-spectrogram
3. **SurfPerch Embedding** - Convolutional neural network extracts 1024-dimensional acoustic signature
4. **Classification** - Random Forest classifier predicts health status based on embedding
5. **UMAP Projection** - Projects recording into 2D space alongside global reef database
6. **Results Dashboard** - Displays health classification, biophony score, confidence level, and visualization

### **Model Performance**
- **Classification Accuracy**: 95% on validation set
- **Analysis Speed**: < 5 seconds per recording
- **Training Data**: 1,000+ labeled reef recordings from diverse global ecosystems
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% for healthy/degraded classification

## üåä **Join the Movement**

Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support 25% of all marine species. They protect coastlines, feed over 500 million people, and generate $375 billion in economic value annually.

Yet we're losing them faster than we can monitor them.

By making reef health assessment instant, free, and accessible to everyone, we can empower global conservation efforts at unprecedented scale.
